    <h1>Maryland football's run game was stagnant at Ohio State</h1>
      <img src="LIA.jpg" alt="Taulia" width="700" height="400">
      <p>Taulia Tagovailoa’s options were limited from the get-go. After the injury to NFL-hopeful Dontay Demus Jr. in Week 5 and another injury to Jeshaun Jones in the first drive of the game Saturday, the second-year quarterback hoped to rely on a running back room that was solid through four games, but that wasn’t the case.</p>
      <p>Maryland’s run game was held to just 56 yards on 36 carries against the Buckeyes on Saturday, including -61 yards for Tagovailoa on eight keeps. It was the Terps’ worst rushing effort of the season by more than 40 yards.</p>
      <p>“When it’s our time to throw the ball, I gotta be able to deliver,” Tagovailoa said. “Whether our running game’s not working, we still believe in our running game no matter what. We’re always gonna try and pound the ball, establish the run. Whether it’s me or the running backs.”</p>

      <p>The Terps’ offense did a better job fighting through injuries against the Buckeyes than the defense did, but they certainly didn’t expect former walk-on Challen Faamatau to be their leading rusher on Saturday. Coach Mike Locksley just hopes that they can find a good mix of run, pass, and RPO going forward.</p>
      <p>“It’s all about balance,” Locksley said. “When we’re clicking, we’re able to run the ball, we’re able to add our RPOs to it, we’re able to throw the ball... How you start the season, doesn’t always mean that’s how you end, based on the personnel you have available, and that’s what we need to take a deep dive into.”</p>
