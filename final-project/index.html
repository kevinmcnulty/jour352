      <p>Down by 18 points in the second quarter of Saturday’s game at Ohio State, Maryland football decided to go for it on 4th and 4 from Ohio State’s five yard line. Taulia Tagovailoa scrambled and scrambled until he couldn’t anymore, yielding a sack that gave the Buckeyes the ball back with just under two minutes to go in the half.</p>
      <p>C.J. Stoud subsequently led his team 82 yards down the field for a touchdown, which all but took Maryland out of the game before heading to the locker room.</p>
      <p>The fourth down stop was critical moment in the first half of a game that ended with a blowout loss for the Terps, and it demonstrated a problem that they struggled with throughout the game: lack of trust in the run game.</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa’s options were limited from the get-go. After the injury to NFL-hopeful Dontay Demus Jr. in Week 5 and another injury to Jeshaun Jones in the first drive of the game Saturday, the second-year quarterback hoped to rely on a running back room that was solid through four games, but that wasn’t the case.</p>
      <p>Maryland’s run game was held to just 56 yards on 36 carries against the Buckeyes on Saturday, including -61 yards for Tagovailoa on eight keeps. It was the Terps’ worst rushing effort of the season by more than 40 yards.</p>
      <p>“When it’s our time to throw the ball, I gotta be able to deliver,” Tagovailoa said. “Whether our running game’s not working, we still believe in our running game no matter what. We’re always gonna try and pound the ball, establish the run. Whether it’s me or the running backs.”</p>

      </script>
      <iframe title="[ Insert title here ]" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-43m41" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/43m41/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="383"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

      <p>It didn’t work out that way for Maryland, however, as none of its touchdowns came via the run. Contrarily, Ohio State had three rushing touchdowns, with two of them coming from star freshman running back Treveyon Henderson.</p>
      <p>The Terps’ offense did a better job fighting through injuries against the Buckeyes than the defense did, but they certainly didn’t expect former walk-on Challen Faamatau to be their leading rusher on Saturday. Coach Mike Locksley just hopes that they can find a good mix of run, pass, and RPO going forward.</p>

      <p>Maryland will enter a much-needed bye week after the loss, and it’ll open the second half of the season against Minnesota on Oct. 23.</p>
      <p>“It’s all about balance,” Locksley said. “When we’re clicking, we’re able to run the ball, we’re able to add our RPOs to it, we’re able to throw the ball... How you start the season, doesn’t always mean that’s how you end, based on the personnel you have available, and that’s what we need to take a deep dive into.”</p>
